# Trivia Survivor 

_Author: David O'Gara_

Trivia Survivor is a movie trivia quiz game with an element of danger. Players will test their knowledge of movie trivia as a creature makes its way towards them. Correct answers will sall the creatures approach while incorrect answers will allow it to advance. When too many wrong answers have been submitted the game ends in failure so to survive players must answer enough trivia questions correctly.

## Demo of the Dead

This version, created as part of an course project will be subtitled 'Demo of the Dead' and focus its subject matter on the zombie sub-genre of horror movies as this will allow for a scope that fits within the time frame given for development.

### Repository

[Github Repo](https://github.com/0davidog/trivia-survivor/)

### Deployed Site

[Trivia Survivor](https://0davidog.github.io/trivia-survivor/)

## External user goal

Users of the site are invited to test their knowledge of movie trivia in a fun survival quiz where they must answer questions correctly or lose from a limited number of lives.  

## Site owner goal

The goal in creating the site is to provide and entertaining and fun quiz that encourages repeat attempts. A secondary goal of this site is to demonstrate the use of Javascript in creating an interactive application.

## Target Audience

The target audience are in this case a movie watching audience, in particular horror movies. This will then appeal to an audience of film watching age of at around 15+ due to the subject matter and age requirements of the films. For this project the scope will focus on films of the zombie genre which, although specific, is an ever-popular subgenre with a sizable audience. A potential future version of the app would include a selection of genres to choose from. 

## User Story 

As a visitor I want to put my knowledge to the test in a quiz and be rewarded for correct answers by ‘surviving’ the game and being a score. I would return to the site to improve my score and try out other modes.  

## Site Owner Story 

As the site owner I want user to make return visits to the site to both improve their score and try other modes. The possibility of failure from too many wrong answers creates a challenge element and immediacy to the quiz and randomised questions assist replay-ability. 

## Design

### Wireframes

Here is a PDF of the wireframes put together at the sites inception. Adobe photoshop was used to visually plan the sites look and layout using an iPhone Xs (375x812) and a Dell laptop (1920x1080) as reference for viewport size/ratio:

### Storyboard

Here is a storyboard for the basic way the creature image advances after each wrong question accompanied by an increasing bar in colours green to red that simbolises the threat level:

### Colour Scheme

The theme and title chosen reminded me of the the playstation game series 'Resident Evil' so I looked to the the late nineties era titles for inspiration and chose to base the colour palette on the inventory screen (pictured below) from Resident Evil 2 (1998). This includes using green and red in the same manner to represent states of 'fine' and 'danger'.

![resident-evil-2-inventory-screen](https://github.com/0davidog/trivia-survivor/assets/135815736/bbf02be4-b9ed-43c2-9d0d-67608a635886) ![color-swatches](https://github.com/0davidog/trivia-survivor/assets/135815736/4b426abc-4d21-4468-a4f1-c8d4e1ac70f7)

Instead of aiming for an exact match however, I found a suitable set of close-matches as part of photoshop's 'Dark' colour palatte in the default swatches collection. Here is a generated palatte courtesy of the site [coolors](https://coolors.co/):

Though not pictured here, the site will use plain white (#ffffff) for the majority of text shown.

### Font-Family

![title-font](https://github.com/0davidog/trivia-survivor/assets/135815736/4241e6d6-fbae-459b-94a3-f31eefd4fc5a)

- For the majority of the text the font choice will be courier new as this fits thematically with a movie trivia game by resembling typed film-scripts.
- For the Headings; a sans serif font, 'League Gothic' was chosen for a dramatic important look to the title.

## Features

### Title Screen

![title-screen](https://github.com/0davidog/trivia-survivor/assets/135815736/ec27a772-e540-455a-ae2b-2f5520bdbb56)

The first thing a user will see it the title screen. The information given is the title of the app 'Trivia Survivor', its sub-title 'Demo of the Dead'. Underneath this the user is asked to enter their name in the input provided and press the start-game button to play the game. The background image used is a darkened version of the illustration used as the main game back drop.

### Select Difficulty

![title-screen-diff](https://github.com/0davidog/trivia-survivor/assets/135815736/ade8b9e5-612c-4c05-9d5a-66ea8210cb9b)

Upon entering their name and selecting the start button the user will then be asked to choose a difficulty from easy, normal or hard. Normal mode is set at 10 questions to answer and 5 lives the user has for wrong answers. Easy mode reduces the questions to 5 while keeping the lives the same. Hard mode keeps the quiz length at 10 but reduces the users lives to 3.

### Game Screen

![game-screen-desk](https://github.com/0davidog/trivia-survivor/assets/135815736/69a30eba-e542-4b5f-b967-e06861ee3c20)

Once a difficulty is chosen the game will begin. The game screen is split into 2 halves. One half displays the image of the creature and the coloured bar beside it. The other half either displays the questions and answer buttons or message text and a button to continue after reading. The majority of time spent in the game here, switching between questions and confirmation text stating whether an answer was right or wrong. On desktop or large tablets viewed in landscape the screen division is set at a left and right while with mobiles and small screens in portrait view the game screen is divided in top and bottom.
